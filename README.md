**This package is in experimental stage and should be used with caution** 
I will keep improving this with time and feedback.  

# microbiomeutilities
This is mainly a _wrapper tool R package_. Apart for some simple scripts for plotting, this package has a single function `microbiome_pipeline` for carrying out preliminary QC, Alpha Diversity, Ordination and Composition analysis of OTU tables. The output is a _HTML_ report for convenient investigating of the data.     
Check the [repository wiki](https://github.com/microsud/microbiomeutilities/wiki)  

Example output of the `microbiome_pipeline`: [here](https://microsud.github.io/microbiomeutilities/index.html).   

**Install microbiomeutilities**   

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("microsud/microbiomeutilities")

```  

**NOTE** The aim of this package is not to replce any of the following tools, instead this package is useful for a quick and (not so) dirty analysis of the OTU tables/biom files generated by tools such as QIIME (the newer QIIME2) (Caporaso, Kuczynski, Stombaugh et al., 2010), Mothur (Schloss, Westcott, Ryabin et al., 2009), DADA2 (Callahan, McMurdie, Rosen et al., 2016). Using the _HTML_ report as a reference for proper analysis is a must.       

## Why do this?  
The entire process of analysing microbiome data is iterative and requires you investment of time for thorough analysis. However, first it is better to have a quick glance at the data. This helps in planning better the individual analysis such as filtering, normalisation, transformation (all three are topics of hot debate and disagreement). The ability to look quickly if the main factor of interst is having an impact on the community diversity, composition, structure can be useful. This will also helps in making better decisions for further in-depth analysis.  
Immediate use can be for people who are working with enrichments and want basic analysis such as microbial composition of different enrichment conditions.      

## Direction for this package   
Depending on the real world usefulness, practicality and success, we plan to include complete or parts of this package in the Microbiome R package.
